Roguelike Tactics Game

My current project which has far too large of a scope :)

Fully functional core systems: Procedurally generated levels, 3D dynamic fog of war, completely open pathfinding based movement, physics based abilities with destructible terrain, and a shape based inventory system.

Currently building a component based item/ability system where abilities are created using a combination of three components, allowing the player to fully customize their unitâ€™s abilities.

Check out the youtube video to see some of the current features:
